# Hi There

I'm Rohan from India, and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics from Trinity College Dublin. I have over 5 years of professional experience in Data analytics working with companies like HP Inc. and Salesforce. I really enjoy learning Machine Learning algorithms and new developments in the world of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
